Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {4, 3, 2, 6}
Output: 
29
Explanation:
For example if we are given 4
ropes of lengths 4, 3, 2 and 6. We can
connect the ropes in following ways.
1) First connect ropes of lengths 2 and 3.
Now we have three ropes of lengths 4, 6
and 5.
2) Now connect ropes of lengths 4 and 5.
Now we have two ropes of lengths 6 and 9.
3) Finally connect the two ropes and all
ropes have connected.
Total cost for connecting all ropes is 5
+ 9 + 15 = 29. This is the optimized cost
for connecting ropes. Other ways of
connecting ropes would always have same
or more cost. For example, if we connect
4 and 6 first (we get three strings of 3,
2 and 10), then connect 10 and 3 (we get
two strings of 13 and 2). Finally we
connect 13 and 2. Total cost in this way
is 10 + 13 + 15 = 38.
