/*
Intuition: We can think of using two pointers ‘i’ and ‘j’, we move ‘j’ till we don’t get a number arr[j] which is different from arr[i]. As we got a unique number we will increase the i pointer and update its value by arr[j]. 

Approach:

Take a variable i as 0;
Use a for loop by using a variable ‘j’ from 1 to length of the array.
If arr[j] != arr[i], increase ‘i’ and update arr[i] == arr[j].
 After completion of the loop return i+1, i.e size of the array of unique elements.
